# Bibata Cursor

TLDR; This cursor set is a masterpiece of cursors available on the internet,
hand-designed by [Abdulkaiz Khatri](https://twitter.com/ful1e5).

This fork is primarily intended for use with my dotfiles.

This fork of Bibata makes the following changes:

- Uses [cbmp-rs](https://github.com/SirEthanator/cbmp-rs) (external dependency) instead of [cbmp](https://github.com/ful1e5/cbmp)
- Remove render.json and split into multiple json files found in the schemes directory
- Added gen_render.sh to combine multiple cbmp schemes into one json file
- Remove all official color variants
- Add Everforest, Catppuccin Mocha, Rose Pine, and Material (must be generated by matugen)
- Removed crosshair shadow
- Added hyprcursor generation to build.sh
- Added bitmap generation with cbmp-rs to build.sh
- Added control of which parts of build.sh to run
- Allow for generation of specific themes rather than all of them

Bibata is an open source, compact, and material designed cursor set that aims
to improve the cursor experience for users. It is one of the most popular cursor sets
in the Linux community and is now available for free on Windows as well, with multiple color
and size options. Its goal is to offer personalized cursors to users.

Feel free to read the [upstream's README](https://github.com/ful1e5/Bibata_Cursor/blob/main/README.md) for other details of this cursor theme.

## Build From Source

### Prerequisites

- Python version 3.7 or higher
- [clickgen](https://github.com/ful1e5/clickgen)>=2.1.8 (`pip install clickgen`)
- [cbmp-rs](https://github.com/sirethanator/cbmp-rs) (see its README for installation instructions)

### Getting Started

Once you have the [build prerequisites](#prerequisites) installed, You can personalize colors,
customize sizes, change target platforms, and more. This process involves using external tools,
as this repository only contains SVG files and configuration for these tools:

- [cbmp-rs](https://github.com/sirethanator/cbmp-rs): Used for customizing colors and generating PNG files.
- [ctgen](https://github.com/ful1e5/clickgen): Used for customizing sizes and building XCursor and Windows Cursors.

You can refer to the README of each tool for more information on their command-line options.

### Building

To generate bitmaps and build cursor files, run `build.sh`. To just generate bitmaps, use cbmp and a config file of your choice from `schemes`. To generate bitmaps for all schemes, run `gen_render_json.sh` with no arguments, then run `cbmp render.json`. To build cursor files without regenerating bitmaps, run `build.sh` with the `--skip-bitmaps` flag.

## Testing Cursors

There are several websites that allow you to test your cursor states by hovering over buttons. This can be very useful when developing or verifying the behavior of a cursor. The following websites cover many of the most commonly used cursors, although they may not include all available options.

- [Cursor-Test](https://vibhorjaiswal.github.io/Cursor-Test/)
- [Mozilla CSS Cursor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor)

For a blueprint for creating XCursors, you may also want to refer to [Cursor-demo](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Cursor+demo).
